## Current Architecture

**Bootstrap Flow:** `main.jsx` → `App.jsx` → `WorkspaceContainer.jsx` → view components

**Data Flow:**
```
WorkspaceContainer (Master State)
  ├── nodes[] + connections[] (shared workspace data)
  ├── viewport state (pan/zoom persistence)
  └── UI state (themes, views, sidebar)
      ↓
  Graph View ←→ Static View
  (Visual Editor)  (Traditional Interface)
```

**Migration Target:** Page-based routing with workspace-specific state management and shared component library.

## Key Features

### Dual Interface Modes
- **Graph View**: Visual node editor with SVG connections, multi-select, context menus
- **Static View**: Traditional sidebar with script editor, categorized content, AI chat integration

### State Management
- **Single Source**: WorkspaceContainer manages master state
- **View Filtering**: Graph shows all nodes, Static excludes script generator
- **Persistence**: Viewport state saved across view switches

### Theme System
Three modes (light/dark/experimental) with dynamic styling and consistent color schemes.

### Enhanced File Management System

- **Scene-Based Frame Sampling**: Intelligent positioning within scenes (1/3, 2/3, start/middle/end)
- **Simplified Detection**: Removed delta intensity veto for better jump cut detection
- **30-Frame Target**: Optimized for 30 frames total with proper scene distribution
- **Video Processing**: Support for Instagram, TikTok, YouTube with automated transcription
- **Document Processing**: PDF, TXT, CSV, JSON, Markdown with full content extraction

## Component Overview

### WorkspaceContainer.jsx
Master state manager handling node lifecycle, view switching, and viewport persistence. Implements radial collision detection for node positioning.

### NodeBasedWorkspaceFixed.jsx  
Advanced visual editor with drag & drop, coordinate transformations, collision detection, canvas bounds management, and 20-action history system.

### StaticScriptView.jsx

## Data Models

**Node Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  type: 'productSpec' | 'ad' | 'script' | 'instructions',
  position: { x: number, y: number },
  selected: boolean,
  expanded: boolean,
  data: { 
    content: string,              // Combined extracted text for AI
    uploadedFiles: [              // File metadata for UI
      {
        id: string,
        name: string,
        size: number,
        type: string,
        uploadedAt: string,
        success: boolean,
        error?: string,
        pageCount?: number
      }
    ],
    extractedTexts: string[]      // Raw extracted texts
  }
}
```

**Connection:** `{ id, fromNodeId, toNodeId }`
**Viewport:** `{ panOffset: {x, y}, zoomLevel: 25-200% }`

**File Processing Flow:**
```
Frontend Upload → Express (multipart) → Python (raw bytes) → PyPDF2 Extraction → 
  ↓
{uploadedFiles: [...], extractedTexts: [...], content: "combined text"}
```

## Backend Processing Architecture

### Jump Cut Detection Algorithm

**Multi-Metric Similarity Analysis:**
- **Perceptual Hash (75%)**: DCT-based structural comparison for major scene changes
- **Histogram Comparison (25%)**: Color distribution analysis for lighting consistency
- **Delta Intensity**: Brightness difference measurement for veto system

**Intelligent Veto System:**
```python
def _is_jump_cut(frame1, frame2, threshold=0.73):
    combined_sim = _combined_similarity(frame1, frame2)  # 75% phash + 25% histogram
    delta_intensity = _delta_intensity(frame1, frame2)
    
    initial_jump_cut = combined_sim < threshold
    delta_veto = delta_intensity > 0.9  # Veto if brightness too similar
    
    return initial_jump_cut and not delta_veto
```

**Configuration:**
- Jump cut threshold: 0.73 (similarity scores below this trigger detection)
- Delta intensity veto: >0.9 similarity prevents false positives
- Target frames: 20 per video with scene-based gap filling

### Debug Tools

**Unified Debug Interface (`debug_jump_cuts.py`):**
- Real-time frame-by-frame analysis with similarity metrics
- Veto status visualization (initial detection vs final result)
- Interactive threshold adjustment with live recalculation
- Generates `jump_cut_debug_report.html` for offline analysis

## Development Notes

**Architecture:** Single source of truth pattern with callback-based updates, React.memo for performance, proper cleanup in useEffect.

**Future Features:** Video assembly workspace, enhanced collaboration, component library extraction.

## AI Tools System

### Tool Management (`/backend/tools/`)

Centralized, context-aware tool system for AI assistant:

**Structure:**
- `tools.json`: Complete tool registry with schemas and metadata
- `toolManager.js`: Smart tool loading based on conversation context
- `toolExecutors.js`: Centralized tool execution handlers
- `index.js`: Clean module interface

**Smart Loading:** AI loads only relevant tools based on conversation:
- Casual chat → core tools only
- "Help with script" → core + script + instruction tools
- "Read workspace" → core + workspace tools

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 Context-aware: 75% reduction in tool overhead
- 🚀 Efficient: Minimal token usage for casual conversations  
- 🛠️ Maintainable: Add tools via JSON, not code changes
- 📊 Observable: Clear reasoning for tool loading decisions

### Prompt Configuration System

All AI prompts stored in `/backend/config/prompts.json`:

**Structure:**
- `base_system`: Minimal core prompt for efficient conversations
- `instruction_modules`: Detailed task-specific guidance loaded on-demand
- `mock_responses`: Fallback messages when API key unavailable

**Dynamic Loading:** AI loads detailed instructions only when needed:
- Casual conversation → minimal 200-token prompt
- Complex task → minimal prompt + relevant instruction modules
- **Result:** ~75% reduction in instruction token usage

**Benefits:**
- Template support with variable substitution (e.g., `{{selectedReferences}}`)
- Easy A/B testing of prompt variations  
- No code changes needed for content updates
- Separation of concerns between logic and content
