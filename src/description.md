# üìò Short-Form Video Ad Creation Platform - Full Stack & Architecture

This document outlines the complete functionality, architecture, and recommended tech stack for the **Short-Form Video Ad Creation Platform**, broken into distinct workspaces:

* **Script Generation Workspace**
* **Video Assembly Workspace**
* **Shared Infrastructure**
* **SVG Timeline and Chunk System**

It is designed to be an evolving reference for technical planning and product development.

---

## üß≠ WORKSPACES OVERVIEW

### 1. **Script Generation Workspace**

* Node-based and text-based script authoring system that uses AI to generate and refine ad scripts.
* Two modes:

  * **Graph View**: visually connect Product Specs, Ads, and Instructions into the Script Generator
  * **Static View**: edit AI-generated scripts in a professional editor with integrated AI assistant

### 2. **Video Assembly Workspace**

* Timeline-based, chunk-driven video editor for assembling, comparing, and exporting video variations.
* Modular design for building videos from Hooks, Product segments, and CTAs.

---

# ‚úçÔ∏è SCRIPT GENERATION WORKSPACE

## üîπ Graph View (Node-Based Scripting)

* Visual workspace for linking content sources into the Script Generator
* Nodes: Product Spec, Ad Example, Instruction, Script Generator
* AI output: 1‚Äì3 variations of chunked scripts (Hook, Body, CTA)
* **Ad Nodes** can be expanded to preview the full video inline (embed or local playback), available in both Graph and Static views

## üîπ Static View (Chunk-Based Script Editor)

### üß≠ Layout Structure

* **Left Sidebar**: Organized into three collapsible sections:

  1. **Advertisements** ‚Äî with video preview for each (selectable to include in context)
  2. **Product Specs** ‚Äî structured data or docs
  3. **Instructions** ‚Äî brand guidelines, CTA formats, tone guides

* **Middle Panel**: Chunk-Based Rich Text Editor

  * Appears only after a script has been generated
  * The script is displayed in modular **chunks**
  * Each chunk includes:

    * **Script Text** (editable)
    * **Camera Direction** (editable metadata for production)
  * Users can:

    * Reorder chunks
    * Edit within chunks
    * Select one or more for revision with AI assistant

* **Right Sidebar**: Collapsible AI Assistant Panel

  * Chat interface similar to Cursor or GitHub Copilot Chat
  * Users can:

    * Ask for rewrites
    * Request new chunks (e.g., "add a hook before this")
    * Add/Delete/Regenerate specific sections
    * Context awareness:

      * Clicking nodes in the left sidebar **adds that node‚Äôs content to chat context**
      * Deselecting removes it
    * This context affects the assistant‚Äôs rewriting behavior

# üß© SVG TIMELINE AND CHUNK SYSTEM

### üîπ Timeline UX Summary

* Each **column** = a script chunk type (Hook, Product Shot 1, Product Shot 2, CTA)
* Each **box** = one video chunk variant
* The **top row** in each column = the selected main video path
* Lines connect the selected top chunks across the timeline
* Vertical "‚ûï" buttons add more variants under each stage

### üîπ Chunk Nodes

Each video chunk node contains:

| Property            | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`              | One of `hook`, `product`, `cta`                             |
| `videoVariants`     | Array of uploaded/recorded videos for this chunk            |
| `scriptText`        | Text associated with the chunk (for reference or adherence) |
| `score`             | Optional AI adherence score per variant                     |
| `thumbnail`         | Preview frame or uploaded image                             |
| `selectedVariantId` | Current version selected for assembly path                  |

### üîπ Focused Path Behavior

* Only the **currently selected path** is **highlighted** with colored connection lines
* Nodes on this path are **slightly enlarged** (e.g., scale 1.1x)
* All other variant nodes are **grayed out** but still interactable

### üîπ Video Node Editing Modal

* **Double-click** a chunk node to open an editing popup
* Features inside modal:

  * Trim start and end (via slider or timestamps)
  * Adjust visible area of video (crop within fixed 9:16 ratio)
  * Upload/replace video variant
  * Add labels or version notes
* On save, updates local chunk state
* Final trim/crop instructions passed to FFmpeg via:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss {start} -to {end} -filter:v "crop=w:h:x:y"
```

### üîπ SVG Timeline Stack

| Component        | Description                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TimelineCanvas   | SVG wrapper that renders all chunk boxes and curved connections |
| ChunkColumn      | Fixed column for a chunk type                                   |
| ChunkNode        | Video variant block with thumbnail + controls                   |
| ConnectionLine   | Bezier curve connecting selected nodes from column to column    |
| AddVariantButton | Adds a new chunk variant to the column                          |
| ZoomSlider       | Optional control for scaling the SVG view                       |
| Node Modal       | Popup for in-place editing of chunk trim, position, metadata    |

### üîπ Rendering Logic

Use `M, C` commands to create cubic Bezier connections:

```tsx
<path d={`M${x1},${y1} C${cx1},${y1} ${cx2},${y2} ${x2},${y2}`} />
```

Highlight top-level path with thicker glow; dim unused variants. Interactivity includes hover previews and click-to-select.
