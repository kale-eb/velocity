# TypeScript Type Definitions Documentation

## Application Purpose
**Short-form video ad creation platform** - TypeScript definitions provide type safety and improved developer experience across the entire platform.

## Planned Type Definitions

### project.ts
**Project-related types** including:
- Project metadata and configuration
- User permissions and collaboration settings
- Project templates and presets
- Version control and history types

### script.ts
**Script Generation Workspace types** featuring:
- Node types (ProductSpec, Ad, Instructions, ScriptGenerator)
- Connection and relationship definitions
- Script chunk structure and metadata
- AI chat message and context types

### video.ts
**Video Assembly Workspace types** including:
- Video chunk and variant definitions
- Timeline state and arrangement types
- Export configuration and processing status
- Adherence scoring and analysis results

### api.ts
**API integration types** covering:
- Request and response schemas
- Error handling and status types
- Authentication and session management
- File upload and processing types

## Benefits of TypeScript Integration
- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **IntelliSense**: Enhanced IDE support with autocomplete and navigation
- **Refactoring**: Safe code refactoring with confidence
- **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation
- **Team Collaboration**: Consistent interfaces across team members

## Implementation Strategy
- **Gradual Adoption**: Incremental migration from JavaScript to TypeScript
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions used across frontend and backend
- **Generic Types**: Reusable type patterns for similar data structures
- **Strict Configuration**: Strict TypeScript settings for maximum type safety

This type system will provide a solid foundation for scaling the platform while maintaining code quality and developer productivity.
