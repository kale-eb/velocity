# Custom Hooks Documentation

## Application Purpose
**Short-form video ad creation platform** - Custom React hooks encapsulate business logic and provide reusable functionality across components.

## Planned Hooks

- Auto-save and version control

### useScript.js

- AI integration for script generation and refinement
- Chunk management and organization
- Script export and formatting

### useVideo.js
**Video assembly operations** including:
- Timeline state management
- Chunk upload and processing
- Video preview and compilation
- Export queue and status tracking

### useAI.js
**AI service integration** providing:
- Unified AI API communication
- Context management for chat interactions
- Prompt optimization and response handling
- Error handling and retry logic

### useUpload.js
**File upload management** featuring:
- Multi-file upload with progress tracking

## Design Principles
- **Reusability**: Shared logic across multiple components
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic separated from UI components
- **Performance**: Optimized with proper dependency management
- **Error Handling**: Robust error states and recovery mechanisms

These hooks will enable clean component architecture by abstracting complex business logic and providing consistent interfaces for common operations across the platform.
