  "summary": "Two young men narrate and show a two\u2011year journey of building content discipline: meeting, practicing social skills, creating videos, late nights, running races, gym training, and eventually monetizing and growing a large following. The reel mixes sit\u2011down narration on an outdoor bench with kinetic b\u2011roll: gym shots, road\u2011race selfies, whiteboard planning, late\u2011night edits, and a morning revenue check. It ends with a promo invite to a live class and a casual sign\u2011off.",
  "visualStyle": "Vertical, high\u2011contrast social reel with fast jump cuts, on\u2011screen captions, selfie footage, handheld run\u2011and\u2011gun shots, and occasional static wides. Lighting alternates between bright daylight exteriors and moody interiors with practical lights. Frequent subtitle overlays guide the story beats.",
