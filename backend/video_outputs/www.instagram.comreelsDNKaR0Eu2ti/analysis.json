  "summary": "Short personal story / promotional reel following the narrator and a friend over two years of content creation. The video alternates between outdoor bench interviews, candid run/gym footage, late-night editing scenes, and promotional calls-to-action about a growth class. The arc: initial skepticism, months of practice (cold approaches + content grind), doubt and late nights, breakthrough moments with a dedicated friend, and a final CTA to join a class that explains how the friend grew his following.",
  "visualStyle": "Vertical mobile-first editing with quick jump cuts and occasional longer scene intervals. Mix of handheld POV (running, cold approach), stable interview-style bench shots, and candid behind-the-scenes in a small apartment and a gym. Bright outdoor daylight for bench/running, warm/muted interior lighting for editing/apartment scenes, and high-contrast gym lighting for workout clips.",
  "audioStyle": "Single dominant narrator voice (conversational, candid, occasionally profane for emphasis) over the full video. Natural ambient audio from street/running/gym scenes layered under narration; energetic exclamations during run/gym moments. The final portion includes direct address CTA with higher urgency.",
