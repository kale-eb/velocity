  "summary": "A 91.2s Instagram-style product / gear rundown where a single on-camera creator shows a selection of cameras, tripods, mics and lighting accessories on a kitchen countertop, intercut with product close-ups and playful moments with a house cat. The narration walks through the creator's favorite gear, highlights a giveaway, and ends with an encouragement to create with the phone already at hand.",
  "visualStyle": "Bright, natural-key lighting with a shallow depth of field on product close-ups. Framing alternates between medium shots (presenter centered at a kitchen counter), close-ups (cameras, earbud mics, small accessories) and occasional selfie-angle handheld shots. Cuts are frequent jump-cuts and short scene intervals typical of short-form social content; camera is mostly static on a tripod for medium shots and handheld for close-ups.",
  "audioStyle": "Conversational first-person narration delivered by a single female presenter. Tone is upbeat, explanatory and promotional; pacing is brisk with short sentences and occasional emphatic statements. Short music bed may appear under some segments (noted visually by cut style) but the provided transcript is voice-forward. The audio includes product endorsement language and a call-to-action for a giveaway.",
