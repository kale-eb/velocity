        "transcript": "That camera may not be cheap, but my favorite tripod is. I've tried almost every other tripod on the market, and I still keep going back to this $20 one-off Amazon. It's lightweight, extends so far, and most importantly, it fits in all my purses. What more could a girl need? When I want to use a DSLR, my go-to has been this sleeper pic from Panasonic. It's called the S9, it's high quality, full frame, and it comes in so many pretty colors. As for filming on your phone, here are my must-have accessories. For crispy audio, the new Hollyland mics are incredible. They're the smallest mics I've ever seen, and you can really hear the difference. Hello! This is my go-to tripod for iPhones. My favorite selfie light is actually not the new Moa. Sorry Alex Earl. I find the Alton light is 10 times better. It has such a sturdy clip, and there are so many warmth settings and brightness settings.",
